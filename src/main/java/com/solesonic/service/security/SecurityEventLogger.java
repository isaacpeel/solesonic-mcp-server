 * </pre>
 * The timestamp and the {@code SECURITY} marker come from the appender pattern rather than the
 * message, so a caller cannot forge them, and every attacker-influenced field goes through
 * {@link Redactor} first. Nothing free-form — no header, no body, no query string — is ever written
 * here: this file is parsed by fail2ban, and a line an attacker can choose is a firewall an
 * attacker can drive.
